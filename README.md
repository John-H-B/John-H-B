### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is my personal github profile. Most of the repos are repurposed from larger pieces of work, but show some interesting effects or just include code that I hope may be useful for others. These other pieces of work I published to our research github, or couldn't be published due to private data.  

If you're working with conditional binary probabilities the <i>PairProbabilityCopulas</i> repo might be of interest.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about multi-objective optimisation and surrogate modelling
