### Hi there 👋

This is my personal github profile. Most of the repos are repurposed from larger pieces of work, but show some interesting effects or just include code that I hope may be useful for others. 

If you're working with conditional binary probabilities the PairProbabilityCopula repo might be of interest.

- 💬 Ask me about multi-objective optimisation and surrogate modelling
